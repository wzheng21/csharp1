# First C# experiment on iterating over mates/entities

It is just too hard to code with SolidWorks API in C++. It
requires quite a bit knowledge on Windows COM interface.

On the other hand, C# API is very friendly for developers.

Under csharp1 folder:
-- Program.cs: top-level setup and teardown for SolidWorks applications

-- MatesLooper.cs: API experiment to iterate over mates and entities.
